## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

- [API Key best practices from Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/maps/api-key-best-practices)
- [How to use Mapbox securely](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/how-to-use-mapbox-securely/)

Exposing your API Key publicly can lead to other people using it to make requests for their own application if the proper precautions aren't in place. Please be sure you read the guides thoroughly and follow their recommendations.

**We don't take any responsibility if you expose your API Key while completing the challenge and have not secured it.**
